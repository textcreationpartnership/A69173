            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the very reading or hearing of which ver≈øe, there is none but will pre≈øently conceiue, it is the voyce of a party in great extremity.
<note place="margin">A complaint.</note> In great extremity two wayes: Fir≈øt, In ≈øuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈ø≈øe, as neuer was any, <hi>If euer there were ≈øorrow like my ≈øorrow?</hi> And then in that di≈øtre≈ø≈øe hauing none to regard him: <hi>Haue yee no Regard all ye?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To bee afflicted, and ≈øo afflicted, as none euer was, is very much: In that affliction, to find none to re≈øpect him or care for him, what can be more?
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.13</note> In all our ≈øufferings it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to vs that wee haue a <hi>Sicut:</hi> that nothing hath befallen vs, but ≈øuch as others haue felt the like: But heere, <hi>Sifuerit ≈øicut?</hi> If euer the like were (that is) neuer the like was.</p>
            <p>Againe in our greate≈øt paines, it is a kinde of
<pb facs="tcp:16273:3"/>ea≈øe, euen to finde ≈øome regard. Naturally wee de≈øire it, if we cannot be deliuered, if wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee releeued,
<note place="margin">Iob 19.21.</note> yet to bee pitied: It ≈øheweth there bee yet ≈øome, that are touched with the ≈øence of our mi≈øery, that wi≈øh vs well, and would giue vs ea≈øe if they could: But this affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted heere, findeth not ≈øo much, neither the one nor the other: but is euen as hee were an outca≈øt both of Heauen and Earth. Now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a heauy ca≈øe, and worthy to bee put in this booke of Lamentations.</p>
            <p>I demand then,
<note place="margin">Chri≈øts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</note> Of whom ≈øpeaketh the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet this? of him≈øelfe, or of ≈øome other? This I finde; there is not any of the ancient writers, but do apply, yea, in a manner appropriate this ≈øpeech to our Sauiour CHRIST: And that this very day, the day of his Pa≈ø≈øion, (truely termed heere <hi>the day of Gods wrath:</hi>) And where≈øoeuer they treat of the Pa≈ø≈øion, euer this ver≈øe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in: And (to ≈øay the truth) to take the words ≈øtrictly as they lie, they cannot agree, or be verified of any but of him, and him onely. For though ≈øome other, not vnfitly, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ≈øay the ≈øame words: it mu≈øt bee in a qualified ≈øen≈øe: for, in full and perfect property of ≈øpeech, He, and none but he: None can ≈øay, (neither Ieremy nor any other) <hi>Si fuerit dolor
<pb facs="tcp:16273:3"/>≈øicut dolor meus,</hi> as CHRIST can: No day of wrath, like to his day: no ≈øorrow to be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his, (all are ≈øhort of it,) nor his to any, it exceedeth them all.</p>
            <p>And yet, according to the letter, it cannot be denied, but they bee ≈øet downe by <hi>Ieremy,</hi> in the per≈øon of his own people, being then come to great mi≈øery, and of the holy City, then layd wa≈øte, and de≈øolate by the <hi>Chaldees.</hi> What then? <hi>Ex Aegypto vocaui Filium meum.</hi>

               </note> that corre≈øpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is between CHRIST &amp; the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, Prophets, and People before CHRIST, of whom the Apo≈øtles rule is, <hi>Omnia in figura contingebant illis:</hi> That they were them≈øelues Types: and their ≈øuffrings, forerunning figures of the great ≈øuffring of the Son of God; which maketh <hi>I≈øaaks</hi> offering, and <hi>Io≈øephs</hi> ≈øelling,

            <p>And this rule, and the ≈øteps of the Fathers proceeding by this rule, are to me a warrant, to expound and apply this Ver≈øe (as they haue done before,) to the pre≈øent occa≈øion of this time; which requireth ≈øome ≈øuch Scripture to bee confidered by vs, as doth belong to his Pa≈ø≈øion, who this Day powred out his mo≈øt precious Blood, as the onely ≈øufficient Price, of the deare purcha≈øe of all our Redemptions.</p>
            <p>Bee it then to vs, (as to them it was, and as mo≈øt properly it is) The ≈øpeech of the SONNE OF GOD, as this Day hanging on the Cro≈ø≈øe, to a ≈øort of carele≈øse people, that goe vp and downe without any maner of Regard of the≈øe his Sorrowes &amp; ≈øuffrings, ≈øo worthy of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. <hi>Haue yee no regard? √¥ all yee that pa≈ø≈øe by the way, Con≈øider and behold, if euer there were ≈øorrow, like to my ≈øorrow, which was done vnto mee, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Lord afflicted mee in the day of the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of his wrath.</hi> Here is a Complaint, and here
<pb facs="tcp:16273:4"/>is a Reque≈øt. A complaint, that we haue not:
<note place="margin">The Parts.</note> A reque≈øt, that we would haue the Paines and Pa≈ø≈øions of our Sauiour CHRIST in ≈øome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. For fir≈øt he complaineth (and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cau≈øe) <hi>Haue yee no regard?</hi> And then (as willing to forget their former neglect, ≈øo they will yet doe it) hee falleth to entreat, <hi>√¥ con≈øider and behold!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what is that we ≈øhould Con≈øider? The Sorrow which hee ≈øuffereth: and in it, two things: The Quality, and the Cau≈øe. 1. The Quality, <hi>Si fuerit ≈øicut:</hi> If euer the like were; And that either in re≈øpect of <hi>Dolor,</hi> or <hi>Dolor meus.</hi> The Sorrow ≈øuffered, or the Per≈øon ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. 2. The Cau≈øe: that is God, that in his wrath, in his fierce wrath, doth all this to Him, which cau≈øe will not leaue vs, till it haue led vs to another cau≈øe in our ≈øelues, and to another yet in him; All which ≈øerue to ripen vs to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe two then ≈øpecially we are mooued to Regard. 1. <hi>Regard</hi> is the maine poynt. But becau≈øe therefore wee Regard but faintly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe either wee Con≈øider not, or not aright; we are called to con≈øider ≈øeriou≈øly of them. As if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, <hi>Regard</hi> you not? If you did <hi>Con≈øider,</hi> you would: if you <hi>Con≈øidered</hi> as you
<pb facs="tcp:16273:5"/>≈øhould, you would <hi>Regard</hi> as you ought. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely the Pa≈ø≈øion, if it were throughly <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered,</hi> would bee duely <hi>Regarded. Con≈øider</hi> then.</p>
            <p>So the points are two: The <hi>Quality,</hi> and the <hi>Cau≈øe</hi> of his ≈øuffering: and the duties two: To <hi>Con≈øider,</hi> and <hi>Regard.</hi> So to con≈øider, that wee <hi>Regard</hi> them, and him for them.</p>
